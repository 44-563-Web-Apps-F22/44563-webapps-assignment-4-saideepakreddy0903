  Chorus of Rapturous MAIDENS and Officers of DRAGOON GUARDS
        ACT II
  <p>[SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
     background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
     distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
     which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
     she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
     she speaks.]</p>

              No. 10. On such eyes as maidens cherish
                          <p class="name">(Opening Chorus)</p>

                              Maidens

                 On such eyes as maidens cherish
                      Lest thy fond adorers gaze,
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
  JANE  The fickle crew have deserted Reginald and sworn allegiance
  to his rival, and all, forsooth, because he has glanced with
  passing favour on a puling milkmaid!  Fools!  Of that fancy he
  will soon weary — and then, I, who alone am faithful to him,
  shall reap my reward.  But do not dally too long, Reginald, for
  my charms are ripe, Reginald, and already they are decaying.
  Better secure me ere I have gone too far!
                  No. 11. Sad is that woman's lot
                       <p>(Recitative and Solo)</p>
                                Jane

  <h4 class="nameJAN">JAN</h4>     
  <div class="speech"><P>Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
     Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
     When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
     Impatiently begins to dim her eyes!
     Compelled, at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,
     To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved
     "combings,"
     Reduced, with rouge, lip-shade, and pearly grey,
     To "make up" for lost time as best she may!
     Silvered is the raven hair,
     Spreading is the parting straight,
     Mottled the complexion fair,
     Halting is the youthful gait,
     Hollow is the laughter free,
     Spectacled the limpid eye,
     Little will be left of me
     In the coming bye and bye!
     Little will be left of me
     In the coming bye and bye!

     Fading is the taper waist,
     Shapeless grows the shapely limb,
     And although severely laced,
     Spreading is the figure trim!

     Stouter than I used to be,
     Still more corpulent grow I—
     There will be too much of me
     In the coming by and bye!
     There will be too much of me
     In the coming by and bye!</P></div>

<p class="direction" class="direction">[Exit, L., carrying her violoncello.]</p>
<P class="direction">[Enter GROSVENOR, R., followed by MAIDENS, two and two, playing
     on archaic instruments as in Act I.  He is reading
     abstractedly, as BUNTHORNE did in Act I, and pays no
     attention to them.]</P>
     No. 12. Turn, oh, turn in this direction
               <p class="song">(Chorus)
              <div class="song"><pre> Maidens
               Turn, oh, turn in this direction,
               Shed, oh, shed a gentle smile,
               With a glance of sad perfection,
               Our poor fainting hearts beguile!
               On such eyes as maidens cherish
               Let thy fond adorers gaze,
               Or incontinently perish,
               In their all-consuming rays!

     <p>The old, old tale.  How
     rapturously these maidens love me, and how hopelessly!  [He looks

     what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity?

<div class="speech"><p>Oh, did he so?  Well, who am I that I should take upon
     myself to withhold my gifts from you?  What am I but a trustee?
     Here is a decalet — a pure and simple thing, a very daisy — a
     babe might understand it.  To appreciate it, it is not necessary
     to think of anything at all.</p></div>

<h4 class="nameANG">ANG</h4>  
<div class="speech"><p>Let us think of nothing at all!</p></div>

<h4 class="nameGRO">GRO</h4> <p class="direction">[reciting]</p>
<div class="speech"><p>Gentle Jane was as good as gold,
     She always did as she was told;
     She never spoke when her mouth was full,
     Or caught bluebottles their legs to pull,
     Or spilt plum jam on her nice new frock,
     Or put white mice in the eight-day clock,
     Or vivisected her last new doll,
     Or fostered a passion for alcohol.
     And when she grew up she was given in marriage
     To a first-class earl who keeps his carriage!</p></div>

<h4 class="nameGRO">GRO</h4>
<div class="speech"><p>I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
     in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
     to the cheek of modesty.</p></div>

<h4 class="nameANG">ANG</h4><div class="speech"><p>Not one; it is purity itself.</p></div>
<h4 class="name">GRO</h4> <div class="speech"> <p>Here's another.</p></div>
<div class="speech"><p>Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
     A great big squirt was his favourite toy
     He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
     And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
     He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
     And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
     He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
     And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
     The consequence was he was lost totally,
     And married a girl in the corps de bally!</p></div>
<p class="direction">[The MAIDENS express intense horror.]</p>

<h4 class="nameANG">ANG</h4><div class="speech"><p>Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
     catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
     hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
     terrible!</p></div>  <p class="direction">[All shudder.]</p>

     sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have

     Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
     Offering love for all their lives;
     But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
     Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
     From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
     For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!</p></div>

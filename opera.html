        ACT II
  [SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
       background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
       distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
       which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
       she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
       she speaks.]

              No. 10. On such eyes as maidens cherish
                          (Opening Chorus)

                              Maidens

                 On such eyes as maidens cherish
                      Lest thy fond adorers gaze,
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
  JANE  The fickle crew have deserted Reginald and sworn allegiance
  to his rival, and all, forsooth, because he has glanced with
  passing favour on a puling milkmaid!  Fools!  Of that fancy he
  will soon weary — and then, I, who alone am faithful to him,
  shall reap my reward.  But do not dally too long, Reginald, for
  my charms are ripe, Reginald, and already they are decaying.
  Better secure me ere I have gone too far!
                  No. 11. Sad is that woman's lot
                       (Recitative and Solo)
                                Jane

  JANE      Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
            Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
            When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
            Impatiently begins to dim her eyes!
            Compelled, at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,
            To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved
                 "combings,"
            Reduced, with rouge, lip-shade, and pearly grey,
            To "make up" for lost time as best she may!

            Silvered is the raven hair,
                 Spreading is the parting straight,
            Mottled the complexion fair,
                 Halting is the youthful gait,
            Hollow is the laughter free,
                 Spectacled the limpid eye,
            Little will be left of me
                 In the coming bye and bye!
            Little will be left of me
                 In the coming bye and bye!

            Fading is the taper waist,
                 Shapeless grows the shapely limb,
            And although severely laced,
                 Spreading is the figure trim!

            Stouter than I used to be,
                 Still more corpulent grow I—
            There will be too much of me
                 In the coming by and bye!
            There will be too much of me
                 In the coming by and bye!

                            [Exit, L., carrying her violoncello.]

  [Enter GROSVENOR, R., followed by MAIDENS, two and two, playing
       on archaic instruments as in Act I.  He is reading
       abstractedly, as BUNTHORNE did in Act I, and pays no
       attention to them.]
              No. 12. Turn, oh, turn in this direction
                              (Chorus)
                              Maidens

            Turn, oh, turn in this direction,
                 Shed, oh, shed a gentle smile,
            With a glance of sad perfection,
                 Our poor fainting hearts beguile!

            On such eyes as maidens cherish
                 Let thy fond adorers gaze,
            Or incontinently perish,
                 In their all-consuming rays!
            Or incontinently perish,
                 In their all-consuming rays!

  [GROSVENOR sits, R.; they group themselves around him in a
       formation similar to that which opens Act I.]

  GROS. [aside, not looking up]  The old, old tale.  How
  rapturously these maidens love me, and how hopelessly!  [He looks
  up.]  Oh, Patience, Patience, with the love of thee in my heart,
  what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity?
  Alas, they will die of hopeless love for me, as I shall die of
  hopeless love for thee!

  ANGELA  Sir, will it please you read to us?

  GROS. [sighing]  Yes, child, if you will.  What shall I read?

  ANGELA  One of your own poems.

  GROS.  One of my own poems?  Better not, my child.  They will not
  cure thee of thy love.  [All sigh.]

  ELLA  Mr. Bunthorne used to read us a poem of his own every day.

  SAPHIR  And, to do him justice, he read them extremely well.

  GROS.  Oh, did he so?  Well, who am I that I should take upon
  myself to withhold my gifts from you?  What am I but a trustee?
  Here is a decalet — a pure and simple thing, a very daisy — a
  babe might understand it.  To appreciate it, it is not necessary
  to think of anything at all.

  ANGELA  Let us think of nothing at all!

  GROS. [reciting]

            Gentle Jane was as good as gold,
            She always did as she was told;
            She never spoke when her mouth was full,
            Or caught bluebottles their legs to pull,
            Or spilt plum jam on her nice new frock,
            Or put white mice in the eight-day clock,
            Or vivisected her last new doll,
            Or fostered a passion for alcohol.
       And when she grew up she was given in marriage
       To a first-class earl who keeps his carriage!

  GROS.  I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
  in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
  to the cheek of modesty.

  ANGELA  Not one; it is purity itself.

  GROS.  Here's another.

       Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
       A great big squirt was his favourite toy
       He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
       And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
       He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
       And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
       He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
       And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
            The consequence was he was lost totally,
            And married a girl in the corps de bally!

               [The MAIDENS express intense horror.]

  ANGELA  Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
  catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
  hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
  terrible!  [All shudder.]

  ELLA  Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, for you touch our
  hearts, and they go out to you!

  GROS. [aside]  This is simply cloying.  [aloud] Ladies, I am
  sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have
  been following me about ever since Monday.  I should like the
  usual half-holiday.  I shall take it as a personal favour if you
  will kindly allow me to close early to-day.

  SAPHIR  Oh, sir, do not send us from you!

  GROS.  Poor, poor girls!  It is best to speak plainly.  I know
  that I am loved by you, but I never can love you in return, for
  my heart is fixed elsewhere!  Remember the fable of the Magnet
  and the Churn.

  ANGELA [wildly]  But we don't know the fable of the Magnet and
  the Churn!

  GROS.  Don't you?  Then I will sing it to you.
              No. 13. A magnet hung in a hardware shop
                         (Solo and Chorus)
                       Grosvenor and Maidens

  GROSVENOR      A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
                 And all around was a loving crop
                 Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
                 Offering love for all their lives;
                 But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
                 Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
                 From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
                 For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!

  MAIDENS             A Silver Churn!

  GROSVENOR           A Silver Churn!

                          His most aesthetic,
                          Very magnetic
                      Fancy took this turn—
                          "If I can wheedle
                          A knife or a needle,
                      Why not a Silver Churn?"

  MAIDENS                 His most aesthetic,
                          Very magnetic
                      Fancy took this turn—
                          "If I can wheedle
                          A knife or a needle,
                      Why not a Silver Churn?"

  GROSVENOR [He rises, going C.]
            And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,
            The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,
            The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
            The scissors declared themselves "cut out",
            The kettles they boiled with rage, 'tis said,
            While ev'ry nail went off its head,
            And hither and thither began to roam,
            Till a hammer came up and drove them home.

  MAIDENS        It drove them home?

  GROSVENOR      It drove them home!

                      While this magnetic,
                      Peripatetic
                 Lover he lived to learn,
                      By no endeavour
                      Can magnet ever
                 Attract a Silver Churn!

  MAIDENS             While this magnetic,
                      Peripatetic
                 Lover he lived to learn,

  MAIDENS and
  GROSVENOR      By no endeavour
                      Can magnet ever
                 Attract a Silver Churn!

  [They go off in low spirits, R.U.E., gazing back at him from time
       to time.]

  GROS.  At last they are gone!  What is this mysterious
  fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across?  A
  curse on my fatal beauty, for I am sick of conquests!  [Goes R.]

  [Enter PATIENCE, L. Stops L.C. on seeing GROSVENOR.]

  GROS. [Turns and sees her.]  Patience!

  PATIENCE  I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald.  I
  wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
  me as fondly as ever?

  GROS.  Love you?  If the devotion of a lifetime— [seizing her
  hand.]

  PATIENCE [indignantly]  Hold!  Unhand me, or I scream!  [He
  releases her.]  If you are a gentleman, pray remember that I am
  another's!  [very tenderly.]  But you do love me, don't you?

  GROS.  Madly, hopelessly, despairingly!

  PATIENCE  That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!

  GROS.  And you love this Bunthorne?

  PATIENCE  With a heart-whole ecstasy that withers, and scorches,
  and burns, and stings!  [sadly]  It is my duty.

  GROS.  Admirable girl!  But you are not happy with him?

  PATIENCE  Happy?  I am miserable beyond description!

  GROS.  That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!

  PATIENCE  But go now.  I see dear Reginald approaching.
  Farewell, dear Archibald; I cannot tell you how happy it has made
  me to know that you still love me.

  GROS.  Ah, if I only dared— [advancing towards her]

  PATIENCE  Sir! this language to one who is promised to another!
  [tenderly]  Oh, Archibald, think of me sometimes, for my heart is
  breaking!  He is unkind to me, and you would be so loving!

  GROS.  Loving!  [advancing towards her]

  PATIENCE  Advance one step, and as I am a good and pure woman, I
  scream!  [tenderly]  Farewell, Archibald!  [sternly]  Stop there!
  [tenderly]  Think of me sometimes!  [angrily]  Advance at your
  peril!  Once more, adieu!

  [GROSVENOR sighs, gazes sorrowfully at her, sighs deeply, and
       exits, R.  She bursts into tears.]

  [Enter BUNTHORNE, followed by JANE.  He is moody and
       preoccupied.]
                         In a doleful train
                               (Solo)
                                Jane

  JANE      In a doleful train
                 One and one I walk all day;
            For I love in vain—
                 None so sorrowful as they
                      Who can only sigh and say,
                      Woe is me, alackaday!

  BUN. [seeing PATIENCE]  Crying, eh?  What are you crying about?

  PATIENCE  I've only been thinking how dearly I love you!

  BUN.  Love me!  Bah!

  JANE  Love him!  Bah!

  BUN. [to JANE]  Don't you interfere.

  JANE  He always crushes me!

  PATIENCE [going to him]  What is the matter, dear Reginald?  If
  you have any sorrow, tell it to me, that I may share it with you.
  [sighing]  It is my duty!

  BUN. [snappishly]  Whom were you talking with just now?

  PATIENCE  With dear Archibald.

  BUN. [furiously]  With dear Archibald!  Upon my honour, this is
  too much!

  JANE  A great deal too much!

  BUN. [angrily to JANE]  Do be quiet!

  JANE  Crushed again!

  PATIENCE  I think he is the noblest, purest, and most perfect
  being I have ever met.  But I don't love him.  It is true that he
  is devotedly attached to me, but I don't love him.  Whenever he
  grows  affectionate, I scream.  It is my duty!  [sighing]

  BUN.  I dare say!

  JANE  So do I!  I dare say!

  PATIENCE  Why, how could I love him and love you too?  You can't
  love two people at once!

  BUN.  Oh, can't you, though!

  PATIENCE  No, you can't; I only wish you could.

  BUN.  I don't believe you know what love is!

  PATIENCE [sighing]  Yes, I do.  There was a happy time when I
  didn't, but a bitter experience has taught me.

  [BUNTHORNE, noticing that JANE is not looking at him, goes off
       quickly up R.  She turns, sees him, and runs after him.]
                  No. 14. Love is a plaintive song
                               (Solo)
                              Patience

  PATIENCE  Love is a plaintive song,
                 Sung by a suff'ring maid,
            Telling a tale of wrong,
                 Telling of hope betrayed;
            Tuned to each changing note,
                 Sorry when he is sad,
            Blind to his ev'ry mote,
                 Merry when he is glad!
                 Merry when he is glad!
                      Love that no wrong can cure,
                          Love that is always new,
                      That is the love that's pure,
                          That is the love that's true!
                      Love that no wrong can cure,
                          Love that is always new,
                      That is the love that's pure,
                          That is the love, the love that's true!

            Rendering good for ill,
                 Smiling at ev'ry frown,
            Yielding your own self-will,
                 Laughing your teardrops down;
            Never a selfish whim,
                 Trouble, or pain to stir;
            Everything for him,
                 Nothing at all for her!
                 Nothing at all for her!
                      Love that will aye endure,
                          Though the rewards be few,
                      That is the love that's pure,
                          That is the love that's true!
                      Love that will aye endure,
                          Though the rewards be few,
                      That is the love that's pure,
                          That is the love, the love that's true!

  [At the end of ballad exit PATIENCE, L., weeping.  Enter
       BUNTHORNE, R., JANE following.]

  BUN.  Everything has gone wrong with me since that smug-faced
  idiot came here.  Before that I was admired — I may say, loved.

  JANE  Too mild — adored!

  BUN.  Do let a poet soliloquize!  The damozels used to follow me
  wherever I went; now they all follow him!

  JANE  Not all!  I am still faithful to you.

  BUN.  Yes, and a pretty damozel you are!

  JANE  No, not pretty.  Massive.  Cheer up!  I will never leave
  you, I swear it!

  BUN.  Oh, thank you! I know what it is; it's his confounded
  mildness.  They find me too highly spiced, if you please!  And no
  doubt I am highly spiced.

  JANE  Not for my taste!

  BUN. [savagely]  No, but I am for theirs.  But I will show the
  world I can be as mild as he.  If they want insipidity, they
  shall have it.  I'll meet this fellow on his own ground and beat
  him on it.

  JANE  You shall.  And I will help you.

  BUN.  You will?  Jane, there's a good deal of good in you, after
  all!
                No. 15. So go to him and say to him
                               (Duet)
                         Jane and Bunthorne

                              [Dance]

  JANE   So go to him and say to him, with compliment ironical—

  BUNTHORNE      Sing "Hey to you—
                      Good-day to you"—
                 And that's what I shall say!

  JANE "Your style is much too sanctified — your cut is too
            canonical"—

  BUNTHORNE      Sing "Bah to you—
                      Ha! ha! to you"—
                 And that's what I shall say!

  JANE "I was the beau ideal of the morbid young aesthetical—
            To doubt my inspiration was regarded as heretical—
            Until you cut me out with your placidity emetical."

  BUNTHORNE      Sing "Booh to you—
                      Pooh, pooh to you"—
                 And that's what I shall say!
                      Sing "Booh to you—
                      Pooh, pooh to you"—
                 And that's what I shall say!

            JANE                                BUNTHORNE

  Sing "Hey to you — good-day to you"—      "Hey,
  Sing "Bah to you — ha! ha! to you"—         Good-day
  Sing "Booh to you — pooh, pooh to you"—        Bah.
  And that's what you should say!               ha! ha!

  Sing "Hey to you — good-day to you"—      "Booh,
  Sing "Bah to you —ha! ha! to you"—               pooh-pooh
  Sing "Booh to you"—                             Bah.
  And that's what you should say!             And that's what I shall
  say!
       "Bah, bah,"                              "Booh, booh,"
  And that's what you should say!             And that's what I shall
  say!
       "Booh, booh,"                            "Bah, bah,"
  And that's what you should say!             And that's what I shall
  say!

  BUNTHORNE I'll tell him that unless he will consent to be more
                 jocular—

  JANE           Sing "Booh to you—
                      Pooh, pooh to you"—
                 And that's what you should say!

  BUNTHORNE To cut his curly hair, and stick an eyeglass in his
                 ocular—

  JANE           Sing "Bah to you—
                      Ha! ha! to you"—
                 And that's what you should say!

  BUNTHORNE To stuff his conversation full of quibble and of
                 quiddity,
                 To dine on chops and roly-poly pudding with
                      avidity—
                 He'd better clear away with all convenient
                      rapidity.

  JANE           Sing "Hey to you—
                      Good-day to you"—
                 And that's what you should say!

  BUNTHORNE      Sing "Booh to you—
                      Pooh, pooh to you"—
                 And that's what I shall say!

            JANE                                 BUNTHORNE

  Sing "Hey to you — good-day to you"—      "Hey,
  Sing "Bah to you — ha! ha! to you"—        Good-day
  Sing "Booh to you — pooh, pooh to you"—        Bah.
  And that's what you should say!               ha! ha!

  Sing "Hey to you — good-day to you"—      "Booh,
  Sing "Bah to you — ha! ha! to you"—         pooh-pooh
  Sing "Booh to you"—                             Bah.
  And that's what you should say!            And that's what I shall
  say!
       "Bah, bah,"                               "Booh, booh,"
  And that's what you should say!            And that's what I shall
  say!
       "Booh, booh,"                             "Bah, bah,"
  And that's what you should say!            And that's what I shall
  say!

                                                   [They dance off,
  L.]

  [Enter DUKE, COLONEL, and MAJOR, R.  They have abandoned their
       uniforms, and are dressed and made up in imitation of
       Aesthetics.  They have long hair, and other signs of
       attachment to the brotherhood.  As they sing they walk in
       stiff, constrained, and angular attitudes — a grotesque
       exaggeration of the attitudes adopted by BUNTHORNE and the
       young LADIES in Act I.]

  [Enter DUKE... enter MAJOR... enter COLONEL, Attitude.  They walk
       to C.]

               No. 16. It's clear that mediaeval art
                               (Trio)
                      Duke, Major, and Colonel

  ALL  It's clear that medieval art alone retains its zest,
       To charm and please its devotees we've done our little best.
       We're not quite sure if all we do has the Early English
            ring;
       But, as far as we can judge, it's something like this sort
            of thing:
                 You hold yourself like this, [attitude]
                 You hold yourself like that, [attitude]
       By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
            [attitude].
                 We venture to expect
                 That what we recollect,
       Though but a part of true High Art, will have its due
            effect.

       If this is not exactly right, we hope you won't upbraid;
       You can't get high Aesthetic tastes, like trousers, ready
            made.
       True views on Medieavalism Time alone will bring,
       But, as far as we can judge, it's something like this sort
            of thing:
                 You hold yourself like this, [attitude]
                 You hold yourself like that, [attitude]
       By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
            [attitude].
                 To cultivate the trim
                 Rigidity of limb,
       You ought to get a Marionette, and form your style on him
            [attitude].

              [Attitudes change in time to the music.]

  COLONEL [attitude]  Yes, it's quite clear that our only chance of
  making a lasting impression on these young ladies is to become as
  aesthetic as they are.

  MAJOR [attitude]  No doubt.  The only question is how far we've
  succeeded in doing so.  I don't know why, but I've an idea that
  this is not quite right.

  DUKE [attitude]  I don't like it.  I never did.  I don't see what
  it means.  I do it, but I don't like it.

  COLONEL  My good friend, the question is not whether we like it,
  but whether they do.  They understand these things — we don't.
  Now I shouldn't be surprised if this is effective enough — at a
  distance.

  MAJOR  I can't help thinking we're a little stiff at it.  It
  would be extremely awkward if we were to be "struck" so!

  COLONEL  I don't think we shall be struck so.  Perhaps we're a
  little awkward at first — but everything must have a beginning.
  Oh, here they come!  'Tention!

   [They strike fresh attitudes, as ANGELA and SAPHIR enter, L.]

  ANGELA [seeing them]  Oh, Saphir — see — see!  The immortal
  fire has descended on them, and they are of the Inner Brotherhood
  — perceptively intense and consummately utter.

  [The OFFICERS have some difficulty in maintaining their
       constrained attitudes.]

  SAPHIR [in admiration]  How Botticelian!  How Fra Angelican!  Oh,
  Art, we thank thee for this boon!

  COLONEL [apologetically]  I'm afraid we're not quite right.

  ANGELA  Not supremely, perhaps, but oh, so all — but!
  [to SAPHIR]  Oh, Saphir, are they not quite too all — but?

  SAPHIR  They are indeed jolly utter!

  MAJOR [in agony]  I wonder what the Inner Brotherhood usually
  recommend for cramp?

  COLONEL  Ladies, we will not deceive you.  We are doing this at
  some personal inconvenience with a view of expressing the
  extremity of our devotion to you.  We trust that it is not
  without its effect.

  ANGELA  We will not deny that we are much moved by this proof of
  your attachment.

  SAPHIR  Yes, your conversion to the principles of Aesthetic Art
  in its highest development has touched us deeply.

  ANGELA  And if Mr. Bunthorne should remain obdurate—

  SAPHIR  Which we have every reason to believe he will—

  MAJOR [aside, in agony]  I wish they'd make haste!  [The others
  hush him.]

  ANGELA  We are not prepared to say that our yearning hearts will
  not go out to you.

  COLONEL [as giving a word of command]  By sections of threes —
  Rapture!  [All strike a fresh attitude, expressive of aesthetic
  rapture.]

  SAPHIR  Oh, it's extremely good — for beginners it's admirable.

  MAJOR  The only question is, who will take who?

  COLONEL  Oh, the Duke chooses first, as a matter of course.

  DUKE  Oh, I couldn't thank of it — you are really too good!

  COLONEL  Nothing of the kind.  You are a great matrimonial fish,
  and it's only fair that each of these ladies should have a chance
  of hooking you.  It's perfectly simple.  Observe, suppose you
  choose Angela, I take Saphir, Major takes nobody.  [with
  increasing speed]  Suppose you choose Saphir, Major tales Angela,
  I take nobody.  Suppose you choose neither, I take Angela, Major
  takes Saphir.  Clear as day!

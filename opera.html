  Chorus of Rapturous MAIDENS and Officers of DRAGOON GUARDS
        ACT II
  <p>[SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
     background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
     distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
     which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
     she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
     she speaks.]</p>

              No. 10. On such eyes as maidens cherish
                          <p>(Opening Chorus)</p>

                              Maidens

                 On such eyes as maidens cherish
                      Lest thy fond adorers gaze,
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
                 Or incontinently perish,
                      In their all-consuming rays!
  JANE  The fickle crew have deserted Reginald and sworn allegiance
  to his rival, and all, forsooth, because he has glanced with
  passing favour on a puling milkmaid!  Fools!  Of that fancy he
  will soon weary — and then, I, who alone am faithful to him,
  shall reap my reward.  But do not dally too long, Reginald, for
  my charms are ripe, Reginald, and already they are decaying.
  Better secure me ere I have gone too far!
                  No. 11. Sad is that woman's lot
                       <p>(Recitative and Solo)</p>
                                Jane

  <h4>JAN</h4>     
  <P>Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
     Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
     When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
     Impatiently begins to dim her eyes!
     Compelled, at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,
     To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved
     "combings,"
     Reduced, with rouge, lip-shade, and pearly grey,
     To "make up" for lost time as best she may!
     Silvered is the raven hair,
     Spreading is the parting straight,
     Mottled the complexion fair,
     Halting is the youthful gait,
     Hollow is the laughter free,
     Spectacled the limpid eye,
     Little will be left of me
     In the coming bye and bye!
     Little will be left of me
     In the coming bye and bye!

     Fading is the taper waist,
     Shapeless grows the shapely limb,
     And although severely laced,
     Spreading is the figure trim!

     Stouter than I used to be,
     Still more corpulent grow I—
     There will be too much of me
     In the coming by and bye!
     There will be too much of me
     In the coming by and bye!</P>

<p>[Exit, L., carrying her violoncello.]</p>
<P>[Enter GROSVENOR, R., followed by MAIDENS, two and two, playing
     on archaic instruments as in Act I.  He is reading
     abstractedly, as BUNTHORNE did in Act I, and pays no
     attention to them.]</P>
     No. 12. Turn, oh, turn in this direction
               <p>(Chorus)</p>
               Maidens
     Turn, oh, turn in this direction,
     Shed, oh, shed a gentle smile,
     With a glance of sad perfection,
     Our poor fainting hearts beguile!
     On such eyes as maidens cherish
     Let thy fond adorers gaze,
     Or incontinently perish,
     In their all-consuming rays!
     Or incontinently perish,
     In their all-consuming rays!</P>

<P>[GROSVENOR sits, R.; they group themselves around him in a
     formation similar to that which opens Act I.] </P>

<h4>GRO</h4>
<p> [aside, not looking up] </p>
<p>The old, old tale.  How
rapturously these maidens love me, and how hopelessly!  [He looks
up.]  Oh, Patience, Patience, with the love of thee in my heart,
what have I for these poor mad maidens but an unvalued pity?
Alas, they will die of hopeless love for me, as I shall die of
hopeless love for thee! </p>

<h4>ANG</h4> 
<p> Sir, will it please you read to us? </p>
<p>[sighing]  Yes, child, if you will.  What shall I read?</p>

<h4>ANG</h4> 
<p> One of your own poems.</p>

<h4>GRO</h4>  
<P>One of my own poems?  Better not, my child.  They will not
cure thee of thy love.</p> <p>[All sigh.]</P>

<h4>ELL</h4>  
<p>Mr. Bunthorne used to read us a poem of his own every day.</p>

<h4>SAP</h4>  
<p>And, to do him justice, he read them extremely well.</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>Oh, did he so?  Well, who am I that I should take upon
myself to withhold my gifts from you?  What am I but a trustee?
Here is a decalet — a pure and simple thing, a very daisy — a
babe might understand it.  To appreciate it, it is not necessary
to think of anything at all.</p>

<h4>ANG</h4>  
<p>Let us think of nothing at all!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4> <p>[reciting]</p>
<p>Gentle Jane was as good as gold,
She always did as she was told;
She never spoke when her mouth was full,
Or caught bluebottles their legs to pull,
Or spilt plum jam on her nice new frock,
Or put white mice in the eight-day clock,
Or vivisected her last new doll,
Or fostered a passion for alcohol.
And when she grew up she was given in marriage
To a first-class earl who keeps his carriage!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
to the cheek of modesty.</p>

<h4>ANG</h4><p>Not one; it is purity itself.</p>
<h4>GRO</h4> <p>Here's another.</p>
<p>Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
     A great big squirt was his favourite toy
     He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
     And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
     He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
     And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
     He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
     And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
     The consequence was he was lost totally,
     And married a girl in the corps de bally!</p>
<p>[The MAIDENS express intense horror.]</p>

<h4>ANG</h4><p>Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
     catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
     hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
     terrible!</p>  <p>[All shudder.]</p>

<h4>ELL</h4><p>Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, for you touch our
     hearts, and they go out to you!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>[aside]  This is simply cloying.</p>  <p>[aloud] Ladies, I am
     sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have
     been following me about ever since Monday.  I should like the
     usual half-holiday.  I shall take it as a personal favour if you
     will kindly allow me to close early to-day.</p>

<h4>SAP</h4><p>Oh, sir, do not send us from you!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>Poor, poor girls!  It is best to speak plainly.  I know
     that I am loved by you, but I never can love you in return, for
     my heart is fixed elsewhere!  Remember the fable of the Magnet
     and the Churn.</p>

<h4>ANG</h4><p>[wildly]  But we don't know the fable of the Magnet and
     the Churn!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4> <p>Don't you?  Then I will sing it to you.
     No. 13. A magnet hung in a hardware shop</p>
                         <p>(Solo and Chorus)</p>
                       <p>Grosvenor and Maidens</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
     And all around was a loving crop
     Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
     Offering love for all their lives;
     But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
     Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
     From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
     For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!</p>

<h4>MAI</h4><p>A Silver Churn!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>A Silver Churn!</p><p>His most aesthetic,
                              Very magnetic
                          Fancy took this turn—
                              "If I can wheedle
                              A knife or a needle,
                          Why not a Silver Churn?"</p>

<h4>MAI</h4><p>His most aesthetic,
     Very magnetic
 Fancy took this turn—
     "If I can wheedle
     A knife or a needle,
 Why not a Silver Churn?"</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>[He rises, going C.]
     And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,
     The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,
     The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
     The scissors declared themselves "cut out",
     The kettles they boiled with rage, 'tis said,
     While ev'ry nail went off its head,
     And hither and thither began to roam,
     Till a hammer came up and drove them home.</p>

<h4>MAI</h4><p>It drove them home?</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>It drove them home!</p><p>While this magnetic,
                         Peripatetic
                    Lover he lived to learn,
                         By no endeavour
                         Can magnet ever
                    Attract a Silver Churn!</p>

<h4>MAI</h4><p>While this magnetic,
     Peripatetic
Lover he lived to learn,</p>

<h4>MAI and GRO</h4><p>By no endeavour
     Can magnet ever
Attract a Silver Churn!</p><p>[They go off in low spirits, R.U.E., gazing back at him from time
     to time.]</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>At last they are gone!  What is this mysterious
     fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across?  A
     curse on my fatal beauty, for I am sick of conquests!  [Goes R.]</p>

  <p>[Enter PATIENCE, L. Stops L.C. on seeing GROSVENOR.]</p>

<h4>GRO</h4> <p>[Turns and sees her.]  Patience!</p><p>PATIENCE  I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald.  I
     wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
     me as fondly as ever?</p>

<h4>GRO</h4><p>Love you?  If the devotion of a lifetime— [seizing her
     hand.]</p><p>PATIENCE [indignantly]  Hold!  Unhand me, or I scream!  [He
     releases her.]  If you are a gentleman, pray remember that I am
     another's!  [very tenderly.]  But you do love me, don't you?</p> 
<h4>GRO</h4><p>Madly, hopelessly, despairingly!</p><p> That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!</p>

<h4>GRO</h4>   <p>And you love this Bunthorne?</p>

  <p>PATIENCE  With a heart-whole ecstasy that withers, and scorches,
  and burns, and stings!</p>  <p>[sadly]  It is my duty.</p>

  <h4>GRO</h4>   <p>Admirable girl!  But you are not happy with him?

  PATIENCE  Happy?  I am miserable beyond description!</p>

  <h4>GRO</h4>   <p>That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!

  PATIENCE  But go now.  I see dear Reginald approaching.
  Farewell, dear Archibald; I cannot tell you how happy it has made
  me to know that you still love me.</p>

  <h4>GRO</h4>   <p>Ah, if I only dared— [advancing towards her]

  PATIENCE  Sir! this language to one who is promised to another!
  [tenderly]  Oh, Archibald, think of me sometimes, for my heart is
  breaking!  He is unkind to me, and you would be so loving!</p>

  <h4>GRO</h4>   <p>Loving!  [advancing towards her]</p>

 <p>PATIENCE  Advance one step, and as I am a good and pure woman, I
  scream!  [tenderly]  Farewell, Archibald!  [sternly]  Stop there!
  [tenderly]  Think of me sometimes!  [angrily]  Advance at your
  peril!  Once more, adieu!</p>

  <p>[GROSVENOR sighs, gazes sorrowfully at her, sighs deeply, and
       exits, R.  She bursts into tears.]</p>

  <p>[Enter BUNTHORNE, followed by JANE.  He is moody and
       preoccupied.]</p>
                        <p> In a doleful train
                               (Solo)
                                Jane</p>

  <h4>JAN</h4>      <p>In a doleful train
                 One and one I walk all day;
            For I love in vain—
                 None so sorrowful as they
                      Who can only sigh and say,
                      Woe is me, alackaday!</p>

  <h4>BUN.</h4> <p>ing PATIENCE]  Crying, eh?  What are you crying about?

     PATIENCE  I've only been thinking how dearly I love you!
   </p>[see
   <h4>BUN</h4>  <p>Love me!  Bah!</p>

   <h4>JAN</h4>   <p>Love him!  Bah!</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>[to JANE]  Don't you interfere.</p>

  <h4>JAN</h4>   <p>He always crushes me!

     PATIENCE [going to him]  What is the matter, dear Reginald?  If
     you have any sorrow, tell it to me, that I may share it with you.
     [sighing]  It is my duty!</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>[snappishly]  Whom were you talking with just now?

     PATIENCE  With dear Archibald.</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>[furiously]  With dear Archibald!  Upon my honour, this is
     too much!</p>

  <h4>JAN</h4>   <P>A great deal too much!</P>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>[angrily to JANE]  Do be quiet!</p>

  <h4>JAN</h4>   <p>Crushed again!</p>

     <p>PATIENCE  I think he is the noblest, purest, and most perfect
     being I have ever met.  But I don't love him.  It is true that he
     is devotedly attached to me, but I don't love him.  Whenever he
     grows  affectionate, I scream.  It is my duty!  [sighing]</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4>  <p>I dare say!</p>

  <h4>JAN</h4>  <p>So do I!  I dare say!

     PATIENCE  Why, how could I love him and love you too?  You can't
     love two people at once!</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>Oh, can't you, though!

     PATIENCE  No, you can't; I only wish you could.</p>

  <h4>BUN</h4> <p>I don't believe you know what love is!</p>

    <p> PATIENCE [sighing]  Yes, I do.  There was a happy time when I
     didn't, but a bitter experience has taught me.</p>
